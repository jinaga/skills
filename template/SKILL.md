  One or two sentences a coding agent uses to decide whether to load this
  skill. Phrase it as a trigger condition, e.g. "Use when authoring or
  editing a Jinaga.NET fact record" — not a summary of what's inside.

# Skill title

One sentence on what this skill is for and who's using it (a developer
authoring facts? a reviewer checking a model? an agent wiring up a hook?).

## Rules

Start with only the rules you can point at a real defect or a real working
pattern for. Two or three is a fine place to start — resist filling this out
to look complete. Each rule should be checkable: something a reviewer (human
or programmatic judge) could point to and say pass/fail.

- **Rule one.** Why it matters, in one sentence.
- **Rule two.** Why it matters, in one sentence.

## Example

A short, concrete code example grounded in the shared task-tracker domain
(`Project`, `Task`, `TaskAssignment`) — trimmed to the idiom being taught,
not a full file.

```

## Common mistake

If there's one failure mode worth calling out by name (the thing that made
this skill worth writing), show it here — the wrong version and the fix.
